# Naïve Bayes Scam Detector
- Assignment 1 for UniMelb subject: [Machine Learning (COMP30027)](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/subjects/comp30027) - Semester 1, 2025; Final mark: 18.5/20
- Includes code (`code-and-data`), assignment specification (`specification.pdf`), and final report (`report.pdf`).
- Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

## Main tasks
- Implement supervised and semi-supervised Naïve Bayes models to detect scam SMS messages using text features.

## Dataset
Make sure all csv files are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook when running:
- `sms_supervised_train.csv`: labelled dataset for supervised training
- `sms_unlabelled.csv`: unlabelled dataset for semi-supervised learning
- `sms_test.csv`: test dataset used for final evaluation

## How to run code
- All results in the written report are reproducable by running all the cells in order in the Jupyter notebook `A01.ipynb`. 
- All code outputs for questions in the assignment specifications are numbered accordingly.
